# **Improving Spatial Awareness in an Intelligent Prosthetic Arm (IPRAM)**  
*Research Project with Prof. Monroe Kennedy at ARMLab, Stanford University*  

---

## **Overview**
This project aims to enhance the spatial awareness of an intelligent prosthetic arm by implementing object tracking across multiple cameras' fields of view (FOV). We eventually aim to use vision language models to perform the detection.


## **Commands to Run**  
To launch the monocular video perception system:  
```bash
roslaunch monocular_video_perception camera_multicam_launch.launch
```
